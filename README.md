# Sales Forecasting using Time Series Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Understanding sales trends is crucial for businesses to optimize inventory, improve marketing strategies, and increase revenue. In this project, we analyze historical sales data and build a time series forecasting model to predict future sales trends.

* Python for data analysis and modeling
* Pandas for data manipulation
* Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
* Prophet (by Meta) for time series forecasting
* Git & GitHub for version control and project sharing

## ðŸ”Ž Approach & Analysis

#### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
* Identified and removed duplicate records.
* Analyzed sales trends across time, categories, payment methods, and customer demographics.

#### 2. Data Preprocessing
* Converted invoice_date to datetime format.
* Aggregated sales data at the monthly level to prepare for forecasting.
#### 3. Time Series Forecasting using Prophet
* Used Facebookâ€™s Prophet model, a robust tool for time series forecasting.
* Trained the model using historical monthly sales data.
* Generated future sales predictions with confidence intervals.
* Visualized trends, seasonality, and forecasted values.
